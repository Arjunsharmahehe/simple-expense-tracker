# Introduction   
Why does it show dollars and not rupees? Well, it was easier to type.

It is a siple expense tracker built using **React**. It is a learning project made with a help of a tutorial on YouTube by **Traversy Media**, link to the particular video is [here](https://youtu.be/XuFDcZABiDQ?si=rXElBuiTnx9QCLeu).    
Tho this is not a type of project you would build using React as it adds an added layer of complexity. It is easier and simpler to do it in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's still fine to do this in react as you can later make it a module and integrate in a bigger project that you might be working on in the future. 

## Learnings
The aim of this projects was to learn and implement React concepts. The learnings are listed below:
- Using a **global context** and not passing props to every component.
- Learning how to communicate information from one component to another.

### Future goals with the project
- [ ] Add a light and dark mode toggle.
- [ ] Store the expenses in a database.
- [ ] Add user authentication.
